        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello.... How's it going! I would like to introduce myself. My Name is Rosa Melendez. I am currently a first-year student. I am currently pursuing to major in psychology. I am currently attending the University of California, Riverside. I have estimated Graduation 2025 in June.  I am a dog and cat lover, and I prefer not to think of what I may like more instead, I love them all equally. I enjoy working with many people and getting to know them. I love to try new food from different cultures to discover new favourite dishes that I may like. I also like going hiking once in my free time and going for a walk to release any stress. I have gone through experiences in which I have taken care of kids, and throughout it, I've learned how kids think a certain way that some adults may not understand and why they may think so differently. 
        I believe that I am easy to get along with after getting to know be and am genuinely a kind and respectful person who cares for others. While majoring in psychology, I admire many the hard work I put into becoming a psychologist, although its work looks pretty easy looking from a different perspective. Although I am majoring in Psychology, my other passion is cooking. I love cooking different food to discover extra food I've never known about before. Also, giving my parents a new experience of other new exciting food dishes they've never known about either. I like finding new things that I may think look interesting that I can recreate and see the ending result as good or not. 
        Those mistakes I would make can help later on by not remaking them again. It would be an honour if this would help you get to know me as a person. It is very nice to get to know more people and help them with any situation they may be going through, and just having to ask for advice can be very helpful to them. What makes me happy the most is seeing people smile so that they can find a solution to their problems no matter what they may be facing. But knowing that people may be happy and not sad is what matters the most as a psychologist but finding a way that satisfies them. 
        Primarily, having patients who think positively is the best thing after they experience some negative parts is a journey to get through and an achievement that I believe many people can get through.  <br><br>
